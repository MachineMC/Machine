## Why Machine

Machine does not come with any default features,
but instead offers a complete API that allows users to easily create their
own custom features and modifications. This flexibility is beneficial for users who require high
performance and greater control over their Minecraft servers.

Machine is a free and open source Minecraft Server software,
which means that anyone can download, use, modify, and distribute its code
without any cost or restriction.

Machine's codebase is clean and straightforward, making it easier for
users to understand how the server works and to modify it as needed.

## Building
* Configure ITJ Gradle to use JDK 17.
* Reload all gradle projects & run newly created task `buildAll` in group `build` of the root Machine project.
